# Clippaper
Set an image in your clipboard to your desktop background.

Don't like the fact that you need to save a photo to your desktop in order to set it to your desktop background?

Clippaper allows you to copy an image from anywhere (specifically, most useful from a web browser) and set it as your background without having you save it to a location.

## Simple How-To
* Right click your image in the web browser you are using.
* Copy the image to your clipboard.
* Click the notification to set the image to your desktop background.
* Alternatively, you can right click the icon in the system tray
* From there, you can set the style of the wallpaper and set the wallpaper if you missed clicking the notification.
